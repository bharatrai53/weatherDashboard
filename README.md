# Weather Dasboard

## Description
The Weather Dashboard is a project that was created to help build on my skills calling an API and traversing through its data to present specific information to an HTML page. In this project, I used the Open Weather API to get data regarding the current weather and the 5 day forecast of weather data given a city. The cities that users search get saved as previous search results that they may refer back to later. 

## Usage
Search a city name in the search field to get data of the 5 day forecast and current weather of that particular city. You will be able to see the project temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
